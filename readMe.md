##Readme-windows version##

- ###**Intro**:###
 - python version: `python 3.x`
 - numpy/scikit installation: `pip install xxxx`/ `conda install xxxx`
 - accelerate installation: `conda install accelerate`

- ###**Advice**:
 - We advise that you install the anaconda `python version 3.x` and install the library-`numpy`, `scipy`, `accelerate` by typing `conda install xxx` at the terminal for easily running all the python files.

- ###**Support**:
 - python installation:
If you install python 3.x, it will be set the environment path automately for windows and install pip at the same time.

 - library installation:
You just need to open the terminal, and type 'pip install numpy' (for example), then it will install the library automately, for more information, you can visit [this website](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) to install pip and install the library using it.

 - anaconda installation:
You can visit [this website](https://www.continuum.io/) downloads to install the anaconda `python 3.x version` for the windows and it will set the environment path automately.

 - accelerate installation:
Because it's a library in the anaconda not for the pip, so you can open the terminal, and type `conda install accelerate`, just like pip install library, and all the processes are automated 
[ for more information](https://docs.continuum.io/accelerate/) . For the GPU verson Option Valuation file, you need to install the numpy and scipy again using 'conda install'.

- ###**Program run:**
 - Just open the terminal, come to the file folder and type `python filename`, it will work.
 - Use the python IDE, like pycharm, and select the right project interpreter, and run each file.

####Have fun :)
